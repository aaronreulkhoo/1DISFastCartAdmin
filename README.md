# FastCart Admin Dashboard
This project was developed as an extension to https://github.com/GrimmWeeper/1DISFastCart, which was originally designed for our **50.001 Introduction to Information Systems & Programming** module in **SUTD**.

## Description
FastCart is an innovative solution that provides supermarkets with an integrated, zero-hassle digital checkout system that augments the traditional customer experience instead of deconstructing it, not compromising on issues such as privacy or cost.

This standalone dashboard facilitates system transactions for an administrative role within the FastCart System, such as managing the product catalog and maintaining inventory in real-time.
